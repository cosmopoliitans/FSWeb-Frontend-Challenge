          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>
            I studied Industrial Design Engineering at Erciyes University. I
            have developed myself in research, self-motivation, entrepreneurship
            and acquiring different skills during my education. That's why I
            think I will adapt easily to team. I completed my internship in the
            department of automotive at Teknokaucuk AS. I have been in Portugal
            for 6 months with Erasmus project. <br /> <br /> I have enrolled in
            a 6-month intensive and accelerated full stack web development
            online school with{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "#4731d3" }}>Workintech</span> , where I learn
            and implement real-life software projects within team environments.
            Through this program, I have gained proficiency in various
            technologies and actively participated in project development.
